> **After spending 40 hours building a screenshot-based shopping agent and running 300 tests to understand its limitations, this project demonstrates the shift to API-based architecture using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for production-ready autonomous grocery shopping across 5 European markets.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup (installs dependencies and configures environment)
./setup.sh

# 2. Run the launcher (interactive menu)
./start.sh
```

## 🚀 The Journey: From Screenshots to APIs

After 40 hours of building screenshot-based shopping agents and running 300 tests, the fundamental question emerged: **"Should we make screenshot-based agents work better, or were they the wrong choice entirely?"**

The answer was clear. This project demonstrates the shift from computer vision-based approaches to **API-based architecture using Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standard that lets AI systems interact with APIs through structured schemas.

### 🛒 MCP Server (API-Based Architecture)
- **Multi-Region Support**: Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Romania
- **Direct API Integration**: No screenshots, no UI scraping — pure API communication
- **Product Search**: Advanced filtering with price sorting and organic options
- **Cart Management**: Add, remove, and view cart items with session persistence
- **Reliable Responses**: Structured JSON outputs for consistent LLM interaction
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive error handling
- **Session Persistence**: Cookie-based state management, not browser state

### 🤖 Production-Ready Shopping Agent
- **100% Success Rate**: Reliable shopping completion (vs 60% with screenshot approach)
- **Sequential Processing**: One item at a time, preventing cascade failures
- **Stateless Operation**: No memory between runs, just single-session task completion
- **Cost-Effective**: 0.42-0.70% of transaction margin in inference costs
- **Batch Testing**: 200+ test runs with comprehensive performance tracking
- **CSV Export**: Structured reports for analysis and business intelligence

## 📊 Production-Ready Performance Metrics

### The Shift: From 60% to 100% Success Rate

The transition from screenshot-based to API-based architecture delivered production-viable metrics across every dimension:

| Metric | Screenshot Approach | API-Based Approach | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Success Rate** | 60% | 100% | +40% |
| **Execution Time** | 30-60s | 30-60s | Consistent |
| **Cost Efficiency** | High operational overhead | 0.42-0.70% of margin | 99%+ cost reduction |
| **Reliability** | UI-dependent failures | API-stable | Production-ready |
| **Maintenance** | High (UI changes = breaking changes) | Low (API contracts) | Minimal overhead |

### Cost Analysis & Business Viability

**Typical Scenario (€39 cart, 3-5% margin):**
- Gross profit: €1.17 to €1.95
- Agent costs: €0.005 to €0.008 (0.42-0.70% of margin)

**Best Case (Private label, 25% margin):**
- Gross profit: €9.75
- Agent costs: €0.008 (0.08% of margin)

**Scale Projection (1,000 carts/month):**
- Monthly inference costs: €8.22
- Gross profit range: €1,170 to €9,750
- ROI: 14,000% to 118,000%

### Quality Assurance Features

- **Sequential Processing**: One item at a time, preventing cascade failures
- **Category Validation**: Ensures food-only product selection with structured data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive API error recovery and retry logic

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (for MCP server)
- **Python 3.11+** (for Shopping Agent)
- **LM Studio** (for local LLM inference)

### LM Studio Setup

**⚠️ Important**: The Shopping Agent requires LM Studio to be running with a compatible model.

1. **Download and Install LM Studio**
   - Visit: https://lmstudio.ai/
   - Download for your platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

2. **Download a Compatible Model**
   - Recommended: `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507` (4B parameters, good balance of speed/quality)
   - In LM Studio: Go to "Discover" → Search for "qwen3-4b" → Download

3. **Start the Local Server**
   - In LM Studio: Go to "Local Server" tab
   - Load your downloaded model
   - **Set port to 1234** (default)
   - Click "Start Server"
   - Verify it shows: `Server running on http://localhost:1234`

4. **Verify Connection**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models
   # Should return JSON with your loaded model
   ```

**📝 Note**: The Shopping Agent is pre-configured to use:
- **Model**: `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507` 
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- **API Key**: `lm-studio` (default)

No additional configuration needed if you follow the setup above!

## 🏗️ Architecture: API-First Design

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

This system uses **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standard that lets AI systems interact with APIs through structured schemas. Instead of fighting with computer vision to extract data from pixels, we work directly with the structured data that e-commerce platforms are built on.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **API-Based**: Direct integration with Rohlik's reverse-engineered APIs
- **Sequential Processing**: One item at a time, preventing cascade failures
- **Stateless Operation**: No memory between runs, just single-session task completion
- **Cookie Persistence**: Session management via cookies, not browser state
- **Structured Data**: Product categories and metadata for better decision-making

SCRIPT_NAME = "rohlik_agent.py"
TOTAL_RUNS = 50  # Number of test runs
```

## 📊 Data Analysis

### CSV Reports

The CSV generator creates three report types:

1. **Detailed CSV**: Complete metrics for each run
   - Execution time, token usage, cart contents
   - Tool call statistics, error rates
   - Item-level pricing and selection data

2. **Summary CSV**: Aggregated statistics
   - Average execution times and token usage
   - Success rates and error analysis
   - Total spending and item counts

3. **Budget Format CSV**: Compatible with existing tools
   - Standardized column format
   - Easy import into spreadsheet applications
   - Historical data comparison

### Metrics Tracked

- **Performance**: Execution time, cycle count, tool calls
- **Token Usage**: Input, output, cache read/write tokens
- **Shopping Quality**: Items selected, prices, cart totals
- **Success Rates**: Completion rates, error handling
- **Cost Analysis**: Budget adherence, price optimization

## 🎯 Lessons Learned: Why API-Based Architecture Won

### The Hardest Decision: Abandoning 40 Hours of Work

The hardest part wasn't building the API-based agent in 6 hours. It was deciding to abandon 40 hours of work on the screenshot approach. **Sunk cost fallacy is real**, especially when you've invested significant time debugging, prompt engineering, and convincing yourself that "one more iteration" will fix the fundamental issues.

### Key Insights from 300 Test Runs

**Screenshot Approach Problems:**
- Every UI change becomes a breaking change
- Every modal dialog becomes a potential infinite loop  
- Every "X" button the agent fails to detect becomes a support ticket
- High operational cost of maintaining a system that fights against the medium

**API Approach Advantages:**
- E-commerce platforms are structured data systems built on APIs
- Using computer vision to extract structured data from rendered pixels is like OCR-ing a PDF generated from a Word document — technically possible, but why?
- When the right abstraction clicks, the code writes itself
- When you're fighting the wrong abstraction, every line is a struggle

### The Signal to Rebuild Instead of Iterate

- When your 10% improvements require 100% effort, you're optimizing the wrong thing
- When fixing one bug creates two new ones, the foundation is wrong
- When you spend more time maintaining the system than improving it, the abstraction doesn't match the problem

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### LM Studio Issues

**Agent fails with connection error:**
```bash
# Check if LM Studio server is running
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models

# If connection refused:
# 1. Open LM Studio
# 2. Go to "Local Server" tab  
# 3. Load a model and click "Start Server"
# 4. Verify port is 1234
```

**"No model loaded" error:**
- In LM Studio: Load a model in the "Local Server" tab before starting
- Recommended models: qwen3-4b, llama-3.2-3b, or similar 2B-8B parameter models

**Slow performance:**
- Use smaller models (2B-4B parameters) for faster inference
- Ensure LM Studio is using GPU acceleration if available
- Close other applications to free up system resources

### Shopping Agent Issues

**"No products found":**
- Check your region setting in `rohlik-mcp/.env`
- Verify the MCP server is running: `cd rohlik-mcp && npm start`
- Try different search terms or check if the service is available in your area

**CSV generation fails:**
- Ensure you have run at least one shopping session first
- Check that JSON files exist in `strands-agent/shopping_exports/`
- Run: `./start.sh` → Option 1 (Single Agent) → then Option 3 (CSV Report)

## 🚀 Production Readiness: What This Means

When we say this system is **production-ready**, we're talking about the approach, not the deployment. The codebase you'll find on GitHub is a fully functional proof-of-concept that demonstrates the technical foundation — API-based architecture, MCP integration, reliable execution, and predictable costs.

**Current State:**
- Runs locally with LM Studio
- Handles single-user sessions through file-based cookie store
- 100% success rate across 200+ test runs
- Cost-effective at 0.42-0.70% of transaction margin

**Scaling to Production (2-4 weeks additional work):**
- Session management via DynamoDB
- Request queuing through SQS  
- Proper authentication and user management
- Multi-tenant support

**The Key Insight:** These are solved problems with clear implementation paths. The hard part — proving that API-based agents can reliably complete shopping tasks with predictable performance — is done. The rest is engineering, not research.
